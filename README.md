  My name is Joseph Wallace, I am a 24-year-old Full-Stack Web Developer. I am from St. Louis, Missouri. My favorite shows are the following: The Avatar the last Airbender, The original Teen Titans and Spongebob. I also have a favorite NFL team which is the Wisconsin Green Bay Packers. I am a very proficient person that likes to try new things out: such as what type of major should I choose in college, and finding different ways of improving my learning skills in life.
